Problem Statement:
Students should be able to cancel their food orders on Grubhub, however they can’t.

Who is experiencing the problem?
Students trying to order food.

What is the Problem?
Grubhub lines are too long for people ordering food, but people are not able to cancel the order if they need to, and are unable to get their meal swipe back. 

Where does the problem present itself?
Russel House/Universities

Why does it matter?
People are busy, and need to be able to get their food and leave, or be able to cancel their order if it takes too long. Students should not have to waste a meal swipe and not get food, just because they couldn’t get their food fast enough in-between classes.
